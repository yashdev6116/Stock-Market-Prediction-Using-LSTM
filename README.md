# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-LSTM
Description
This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to perform time series forecasting using Keras and TensorFlow. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations to showcase predictions and loss trends.

Features
Data Preprocessing:
Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn were used to clean and prepare the time series data.

LSTM Model Implementation:
Built an LSTM network using the Sequential API in Keras.
Layers include LSTM and Dense layers for model architecture.

Visualization:
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting model performance and predictions.
Includes graphs for loss trends and predicted vs actual values.

Evaluation:
Model performance was evaluated using metrics like loss.

Tools & Libraries
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Modeling: Keras, TensorFlow
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
API Integration: Alpha Vantage API for time series data retrieval
Miscellaneous: Datetime, Requests

Dataset
The project uses a response JSON file fetched from an API (e.g., Alpha Vantage) for the time series dataset.
Project Workflow
Import and clean the dataset.
Preprocess the data (scaling, reshaping, and sequence preparation).
Build and compile the LSTM model.
Train the model using the fit() method.
Evaluate and visualize performance using metrics like loss and predictions.
Save and use the model for inference.
